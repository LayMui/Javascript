JS - The most dynamic language
In Java
//String a = ‘moo’
a = 1 // error in java


Compilation vs polyfilling
```
Not all browser support JS
JS always backward compatible
As developer u want a newer version of JS, but not all browser support it
Compiler compile down to older JS – one of the compiler is called Babel.
Ex: let x = “2” -> var x = “2”

```

```
Promise() – new feature 
Need polyfill – polyfill is a new code that when you import into your project give you that feature 
Rewrite the promise and allow you to run in older browser.
```
